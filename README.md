# FDK Reference data

This application provides a common API (REST & GraphQL) for codelists, concepts, help texts and other kinds of reference
data that are used by many other applications in the overall architecture. The application imports the reference data
from various sources as scheduled tasks.

For a broader understanding of the systemâ€™s context, refer to
the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation) wiki.
